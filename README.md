Goals for 2025

In the coming year, I aim to deepen my expertise by earning the Appian Certified Senior Developer certification. This credential will enhance my ability to deliver Appian solutions that reduce costs, improve productivity, and enhance both efficiency and customer experience. Reflecting on my Appian development efforts this past year, I found that actively seeking diverse perspectives through peer reviews provided invaluable feedback. This approach enabled me to consistently implement best-practice solutions.

Additionally, I plan to build on the training I completed in 2024 by pursuing the Blue Prism Associate Developer Certification. I will collaborate with Blue Prism subject matter experts to identify opportunities for applying my new knowledge in ways that bring measurable value to business users.

Accomplishments and Impacts

1. Responding to Customer Needs – L2 Production Support
	•	Evidence: Successfully collaborated with business users and the development team to deploy the SCRT, SMRR, and Borrower’s Notification applications to UAT. These applications were later deployed to the production environment. I also facilitated the onboarding of two applications, ensuring compliance with the PlainID Zero Trust Authentication process.
	•	Impact: These successful deployments contributed to nine OCC releases, including four new builds for Receipt Reclass, Reclass of Funds, CMO Approval Processes, and Borrower Notification.

2. Delivering the SCRA and BMI Applications
	•	Evidence: From conception to production deployment, I worked collaboratively with both business stakeholders and the internal development team throughout the project lifecycle. This involved translating business requirements into actionable deliverables and creating custom features such as visual components and audit tracking. These enhancements improved productivity, efficiency, and customer experience.
	•	Impact: My efforts were recognized by Jaipal Metu and Gora Gangopadhyay for significantly reducing the EUC footprint within Operations by migrating legacy EUCs to the Appian platform.
