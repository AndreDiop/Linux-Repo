Goals for 2025

In 2025, I aim to further elevate my contributions by earning the Appian Certified Senior Developer certification. This will enhance my ability to design scalable and cost-effective Appian solutions that align with Fannie Mae’s mission of operational excellence and delivering exceptional customer experiences. Over the past year, I have embraced collaborative practices, such as peer reviews, to integrate diverse perspectives and implement best-practice solutions—an approach I will continue to refine as I work toward this certification.

Additionally, I plan to expand my technical expertise by pursuing the Blue Prism Associate Developer Certification. Through collaboration with Blue Prism subject matter experts, I will identify practical applications of robotic process automation (RPA) to streamline workflows and create measurable value for business users. This initiative will complement my existing Appian development skills and allow me to deliver a broader range of impactful solutions.

Accomplishments and Impacts

1. Obtaining Appian Certified Developer Certification
	•	Evidence: By combining the foundational knowledge from my Appian bootcamp with practical experience managing EUCs, I successfully earned my Appian Certified Developer credential.
	•	Impact: This certification validated my comprehensive understanding of the Appian platform and equipped me to design solutions that address both technical and business challenges. It has strengthened my ability to implement effective workflows, improve operational efficiency, and deliver value to internal and external stakeholders daily.

2. Responding to Customer Needs – L2 Production Support
	•	Evidence: I collaborated with business users and development teams to deploy the SCRT, SMRR, and Borrower Notification applications to UAT and later to the production environment. I also facilitated the onboarding of two applications, ensuring full compliance with the PlainID Zero Trust Authentication process.
	•	Impact: These deployments were integral to nine OCC releases in 2024, including four new builds for Receipt Reclass, Reclass of Funds, CMO Approval Processes, and Borrower Notification. This work not only met critical compliance requirements but also streamlined operations, supporting Fannie Mae’s broader goals of process optimization and risk mitigation.

3. Delivering the SCRA and BMI Applications
	•	Evidence: I proactively bridged gaps between business stakeholders and internal development teams, translating complex requirements into actionable deliverables. I designed custom solutions, including advanced visual components and audit tracking features, that improved productivity and user experience.
	•	Impact: This initiative earned recognition from Jaipal Metu and Gora Gangopadhyay for my role in reducing the EUC footprint within Operations. By migrating legacy EUCs to the Appian platform, I contributed to a more scalable, secure, and efficient operating environment, reducing risks and improving compliance by an estimated X%.

4. Facilitating Seamless Deployments Across Multiple Applications
	•	Evidence: I led collaborative efforts to deploy SCRT, SMRR, and Borrower Notification applications to UAT and production, ensuring all deliverables met quality and compliance standards.
	•	Impact: These projects supported nine successful OCC releases and directly contributed to operational enhancements that improved productivity and reduced costs for business users.

Closing Summary

In 2024, I demonstrated my ability to merge technical expertise with collaborative problem-solving to deliver measurable results for Fannie Mae.
